1. **It is not a battle game**. It is a adventure and objective-based game[¹]. Don't just spend actions going after enemies, as they will come to you themselves[²]. Using keyword cards that allow you to move or act for free allows you to have an even greater number of effective actions[⁴]. Therefore, sprint cards is too strong.

2. **Question your attacks**. First, can I kill it? Second, do I need to kill it [¹] [²]? Counterattacks are bad, so only attack if you can finish them the first time and/or if it will help you achieve your objective[³]. Even if you gain 1 inspiration from killing a group, how many inspirations did you spend to do so[⁴]?

3. **Scout is strong**. Scout lets you improve your chances when trying to pass tests[¹], by stacking success cards and preparing blank or inspiration cards[²]. If you don't have four useful cards prepared, you can even prepare a weakness card to keep it out of your testing deck[³]! If you can use a success card in this turn, prepare it, if not, topdeck it[²].

4. **Use your prepared cards**. In general, the most powerful effects are printed on success cards[²] [⁴]. The more success cards you prepare, the less success will be in a test, so try to leave a maximum of 2 success cards prepared[²]. Once prepared a success card, use it in asap [²] [⁴].

5. **Last stands are not the end**. Starting with 1 success, each hero's "last stand" test increases by one success to be successful in the chapter. Therefore, the first two "last stand" are easy to pass[¹]. Don't waste success and inspiration trying to avoid "last stand", as by passing the "last stand" you still discard damage, fears and gain inspiration[²] [⁶].

6. **Take the hit**. Health is also a resource, so it's not a good idea not to use it. Every resource you spend protecting your health you could have spent doing something more productive[²] [⁶].

7. **Do not ignore lore**. Only lore can upgrade your gears, useful to win battles and complete quests[¹]. Complete the side quests to collect lore, but caution to the Threat Clock[¹]!

8.  **Prioritize the board**. From most important to less[¹] [²]:

    1. Threat tokens. Threat tokens and unexplored tiles increase threat clock speed, so must be resolved asap in order to play more rounds.
    2. Unexplored tiles. Try to explore tiles after resolving threat tokens and as soon as the round starts, to give time to resolve possible threat tokens revealed[¹] [²]. Tiles near the fog reveal more tiles[²] [⁴].
    3. Interaction tokens.
    4. Killing enemies.

9.  **Know the characters and roles**. Although you can make others builds work, it almost always better stick wit the the assigned roles and equipments[³]. The best characters are Aragorn, Legolas and Elena[⁵]. Good builds:

   1. Legolas+hunter+bow! Better combination to combat because avoid most counterattacks, 3 success gives 7 hits, enough to kill anything early in the game and tier 2 bow plus hunter cards can wipe out groups of elite[³].
   2. Beravor+pathfinder on journey maps. It is not uncommon for Beravor to have the entire board uncovered after 3 turns, letting others carry out the tests most of the time. For battle maps with larger groups, Beravor can yet be pathfinder, but with smaller groups I'd recommend switching out for a combat class like captain or even burglar. Use whatever scouts you can get to search for sprints, and keep sprinting to build inspiration[³].
   3. Elena+Bard to heal, spread inspiration and do testing.
   4. Captain is also one of the best roles as it grants you lots of extra action economy and access to the best card in the game, Master Tactician[⁵]
   5. Guardian is the least necessary class[³] [⁵].

10.  **Master Tactician is the best card** [²] [³] [⁵]. It lets the entire party search for theis best cards and get prepared for the best possible round[³].

11. **Losing a chapter is not the end**. Especially if you lose it late. After you've already got all the Lore and Trinkets in the chapter, all you lose is one experience, that's not a big deal[²].

12. **Learn to predict tests**. This way, you can decide who will take the tests and wich cards to prepare with scouting[³]:

    1. Might – knocking something over, chopping something down, forcing through particularly heavy plants/underbrush, absorbing physical damage.
    2. Agility – navigating uneven or slippery terrain, moving quickly, climbing.
    c. Wisdom – healing, lore, reading runes, remembering, knowledge.
    3. Spirit – anything dealing with darkness, fear, overwhelming stench, communing with undead, anything that feels evil. Anything that would require force of will.
    4. Wit – quick thinking, sneaking, solving riddles, taunting, friendly banter.

13. **Click on things**. Click on search tokens to remember what they are. Click on people to see if they have any interact options left. Click on threat events to see if you can guess if it’s going to be some kind of darkness/fear thing or a new wave of monsters. Click on enemies to plan out the best ways to attack them[³].

14. **Faceup Damage and Fear is difficult to get rid of**. There are very few ways to flip a permanent faceup card facedown or to get rid of it entirely[⁶], like Arwen's personal hability, human characters's Gift of Men cards and the best option, Food Trinket[⁶].
