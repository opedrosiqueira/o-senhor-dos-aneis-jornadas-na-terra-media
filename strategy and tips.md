# Journeys in the Middle Earth Strategy and tips

1. **It is not a battle game**: It is an adventure and objective-based game[¹]. Avoid solely targeting enemies, as they'll approach you naturally[²]. Utilize keyword cards for free movement or actions to maximize your actions[⁴]. Therefore, sprint cards are great.

2. **Question your attacks**: First, can I kill it? Second, do I need to kill it[¹][²]? Avoid counterattacks; attack only if you can finish them or if it aligns with your objectives[³]. Consider the cost-effectiveness of gaining 1 inspiration against the inspirations spent on the endeavor[⁴].

3. **Scout boosts test success**: Enhance your tests  by stacking success cards and preparing blank or inspiration cards[¹][²]. If you don't have four useful cards prepared, prepare a weakness card to exclude it from your testing deck[³]. If you can use a success card in this turn, prepare it, if not, topdeck it[²].

4. **Use your prepared cards**: In general, the best cards are success cards[²][⁴]. Limit prepared success cards to a maximum of 2 to ensure a higher success rate in tests[²]. Utilize prepared success cards promptly[²][⁴].

5. **Last stands are not the end**: Last stand tests start with 1 success, incrementing by 1 success per test, resetting in the next chapter. Therefore, the first two are easy[¹]. Avoid spending success and inspiration to evade last stands, as passing them discards damage, fears and gain inspiration[²][⁶].

6. **Take the hit**: Health is also a resource, so use it. Every resource spent on health protection could be utilized otherwise[²][⁶].

7. **Value the lore**: Only lore can upgrade gears, essential for battles and quests[¹]. Complete side quests to gain lore, but beware the threat bar[¹]!

8. **Prioritize the board**: From most to least important[¹] [²]:

    1. Threat tokens. Threat tokens and unexplored tiles increase threat bar speed, so must be resolved asap in order to play more rounds.
    2. Unexplored tiles: Explore them after resolving threat tokens and at the beginning of the round, to give time to resolve potential threat tokens revealed[¹] [²]. Tiles near the fog reveal more tiles[²] [⁴].
    3. Interaction tokens.
    4. Killing enemies.

9. **Understand characters and roles**: While other builds can work, it's generally better to stick with default roles and equipment[³]. Top characters include Aragorn, Legolas and Elena[⁵]. Recommended builds:

   1. Legolas+Hunter+Bow: An effective combat combo: minimize counterattacks; 3 success yields 7 hits, enough for early-game kills. Tier 2 bow and hunter cards can clear groups of elites[³].
   2. Beravor+Pathfinder on journey maps: Beravor swiftly reveals the entire board in 3 turns, allowing teammates to focus on tests. In battle maps with many heroes, Beravor can remain as pathfinder; with few heroes, consider changing to a combat class like captain or even burglar. Scout for sprints and keep sprinting to gain inspiration[³].
   3. Elena+Bard: Good for healing, inspiring, and conducting tests.
   4. Captain: A versatile role providing extra actions and access to the best card in the game, Master Tactician[⁵].
   5. Guardian: The worst class, don't choose it[³] [⁵].

10. **Master Tactician reigns supreme** [²] [³] [⁵]: It lets the entire party search their best cards, ensuring an outstanding round[³].

11. **Losing a chapter is not the end**: Especially late. Once you've acquired all the Lore and Trinkets, the only loss is one experience, which isn't significant[²].

12. **Learn to predict tests**: This way, you can decide who will take the tests and scout for cards to prepare[³]:

    1. **Might**: Knocking over objects, chopping down obstacles, forcing through heavy vegetation, absorbing damage.
    2. **Agility**: Navigating uneven or slippery terrain, moving quickly, climbing.
    3. **Wisdom**: Healing, lore, rune reading, memory, knowledge.
    4. **Spirit**: Dealing with darkness, fear, overwhelming stench, communing with undead, force of will.
    5. **Wit**: Quick thinking, sneaking, solving riddles, taunting, friendly banter.

13. **Click on things**: Click on search tokens to recall contents, people to explore interact options left, threat for insight into potential challenges, and enemies to view their health[³].

14. **Managing Faceup Damage and Fear**: Flipping or eliminating them is challenging[⁶]. Limited options include Arwen's ability, human characters' Gift of Men cards, and the best option, Food Trinket[⁶].
